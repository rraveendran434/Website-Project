                  <cite>"We've been to many pizza restaurants over the years. we've traveled across the entire country to see if the perfect pizza place existed. Then we came across the Mo's Pizza Shack. After eating here my life has changed. I used to live in California, buta after trying this pizza I decided to move to New York. The Hot Cheetos pizza at Mo's Pizza Shack is one of the best pizza's I've ever eaten. The people, the food, the atmosphere, its all there. Its the best pizza place in the United States. 10/10</cite>

                  <cite>"We used to think we had good pizza, but after eating at Mo's Pizza Shack we were wrong. The fact that they use real ingredients already puts us to shame. Then theres the fantastic workers. They always make us laugh and show us a great time at the restaurant. What are we even doing anymore. 10/10"</cite>

                 <cite>"This restaurant is crazy. The workers, and the food are amazing. Many people say that the hot cheetos pizza is their best pizza but I think that their best pizza is their pepperoni pizza. The hot cheetos pizza is to spicy for me and it hurts the whole pizza in my honest opinion. Everything else is absolutley amazing. 9/10"</cite>

That was until i entered this small little restaurant called Mo's Pizza Shack. The restaruant looks amazing. The workers are very nice. They treat me like their own family. And the food is just fantastic. Some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. 4/5 "</cite>
